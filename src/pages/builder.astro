# Mission Builder

Create your own AI-powered learning missions with our interactive builder. Get AI suggestions for activities, scaffolds, assessments, and resources.

## Mission Creation Steps

1. **Define Your Vision** - What community need or student interest drives this mission?
2. **Set Learning Goals** - What standards and competencies will students develop?
3. **Design Activities** - Plan the sequence of learning experiences
4. **Build Assessments** - Create rubrics and checkpoints for student growth
5. **Gather Resources** - Curate materials, tools, and community partnerships
6. **Launch & Iterate** - Refine based on real student learning

## AI-Assisted Features

Our Mission Builder uses AI to help you:

- **Generate ideas** for engaging project challenges aligned to standards
- **Scaffold learning** with differentiated supports and activity sequences
- **Create rubrics** that emphasize real-world competencies
- **Find resources** including texts, videos, tools, and community partnerships
- **Adapt missions** for different contexts, grade levels, and learner needs
