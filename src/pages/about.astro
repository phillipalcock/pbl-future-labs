        <p style="color: #6B6560; font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 520px;">We're building Project-Based AI Experiences for K-12. Everything we teach comes from working directly with students and schools.</p>

    <!-- Origin Story -->
    <section class="scroll-reveal" style="padding: 2rem 0 3rem;">
        <h2 class="mb-6">Where this came from.</h2>
        <div style="color: #6B6560; max-width: 580px;">
            <p class="mb-5">While everyone else was debating whether AI would kill education, Thom Markham and Phil Alcock started building what comes next.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Thom had spent 15+ years developing the project-based learning methodology used in thousands of classrooms worldwide. Phil had been deep in AI integration, building tools and workflows for educators and amassing a following of 10,000+ teachers on LinkedIn. They saw what most people missed: AI doesn't threaten great project-based learning — it supercharges it.</p>
            <p>They spent two years prototyping with real schools. What they built is a complete system for using AI at every stage of a project — from design to student engagement to assessment. They call it Project-Based AI Experiences, and it's the foundation of everything at PBL Future Labs.</p>
