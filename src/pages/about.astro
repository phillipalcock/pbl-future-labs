            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Origin Story</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                    PBL Future Labs started with a simple observation: when ChatGPT arrived, most educators either panicked or pretended it didn't exist. The PBL community was no different — decades of great work on project-based learning, but no clear answer for how AI fits in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phil Alcock — an Australian educator living in Acapulco, Mexico — saw the gap immediately. As someone who thinks in systems (thanks to a neurodivergent brain that won't stop connecting dots), he recognized that AI wasn't a threat to PBL. It was the missing piece. The thing that could finally make project design fast enough, research deep enough, and assessment continuous enough to work at scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He partnered with Thom Markham, Ph.D. — the author of three definitive books on project-based learning and a recognized global expert in PBL methodology. Together, they built what became PBL 2.0: a concrete framework for integrating AI into every stage of the project cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PBL Future Labs is the home for that work. We create courses, books, coaching programs, and tools for K-12 educators who want practical, Monday-morning-ready approaches to AI-powered PBL.

                            Australian-born, Acapulco-based educator and systems thinker. Phil brings a neurodivergent perspective (ADHD/autism) to learning design — seeing patterns and building frameworks that work for diverse learners, not just the "typical" student.

                <p>
                    We work from Acapulco, Mexico — and that's deliberate. Being outside the US education bubble gives us perspective. We test ideas across cultures and contexts, not just one school district.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lab is where we prototype new AI workflows, develop course materials, and run pilot programs with schools around the world. It's also where we prove that meaningful education work can happen from anywhere — you don't need a Silicon Valley address to do work that matters.
